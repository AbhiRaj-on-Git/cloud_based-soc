<h3>Cloud-Based SOC Project</h3>

Built a SOC lab on Vultr cloud including Windows and Ubuntu machines integrated with Elastic SIEM. Configured dashboards and alerts for login activity (Windows RDP & SSH). Simulated attacks using Kali Linux (brute force and Mythic C2 Apollo via PowerShell IEX) and monitored logs in ELK. Integrated alerts with osTicket for automated incident ticketing.

<h4>SOC Lab Architecture<h4/>
  
The diagram illustrates a cloud-based SOC setup on Vultr. Windows (RDP) and Ubuntu (SSH) servers forward logs via a Fleet server to Elastic/Kibana for centralized monitoring and alerting. A separate osTicket server generates tickets from alerts. An attackerâ€™s Kali Linux machine and a Mythic C2 server simulate threats, while the SOC analyst accesses Elastic/Kibana via the web for detection and response.
